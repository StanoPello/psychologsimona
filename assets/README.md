# Assets

- Place your background video as `assets/video.mp4`.
- Optional: add a poster image `assets/poster.jpg`.

Replacing the video
- Replace `assets/video.mp4` with your own file using the same name, or edit `index.html` to point to a different filename or external URL.
- Keep the <video> attributes: `autoplay`, `muted`, `loop`, `playsinline` for mobile autoplay.
- Suggested sources for royalty‑free footage: Pexels, Coverr.

Fallbacks
- Two external fallback sources are included in <source> tags; you can remove or update them anytime.

Performance
- Prefer 1080p MP4 (H.264) ~10–25 MB. For mobile, try 720p if heavy.
